# Cognitive-Impairment-Prediction-with-MRI-Data
This project implements an XGBoost-based classification model to address a predictive modeling task. The workflow includes comprehensive data preprocessing, such as handling null values, detecting and removing outliers, feature engineering, and standardization. The model undergoes hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV, with early stopping integrated to prevent overfitting and improve training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, ROC-AUC score, and learning curves, are used to assess model performance. Additionally, feature importance analysis provides insights into the key predictors driving the model's decisions. The project leverages Python libraries such as XGBoost, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data handling, model training, and result visualization. The code is modular and well-documented, allowing easy replication and fine-tuning for similar classification tasks.
